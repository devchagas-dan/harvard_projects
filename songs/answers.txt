If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I would chacacterize their auras as purple.


Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
...> What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
I think it would be nice to insert on the table the type of each song. This way it would be a little more precise.
