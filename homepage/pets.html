                    <p class="text-display">Tom is a straight cat who is 15 years old. He's lovely, gentle and needy. He loves affection and companion.</p>

                    <h3>Nina</h3>
                    <p class="text-display">Nina is half Persian half straight cat who is 4 years old. She is such a lady, very quiet, calm.
                        She has an anti social behaviour...hehehe. She is not needy, doesn't like affection.</p>

                    <h3>Simba</h3>
                    <p class="text-display">Simba is my beloved Frajolinha (How we Brazilians name most black and white cats). He is wonderful! Such a lovely cat. He loves interacting with humans, in general.
                        He is only 3 years old. </p>

                    <h3>Fumacinha</h3>
                    <p class="text-display">Fumacinha(Smoky) is a very energetic cat, I think because he is a kitten yet. He's got his name because of his smoky face. He bothers everyone in the house.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <img src="images/Lynx.jpeg" width="300" height="200"/>
                    <h3>Lynx</h3>
                    <p class="text-display">Lynx is Fumacinha's sister. I've rescued them from street. They were abandoned by their previous human in a weed near my mom's house.
                        Lynx has got her name because she looks like a real Lynx but smaller. She is very energetic too, but very affectionate!</p>
