                First of all, let me introduce myself. My name is <b>Daniela Chagas Cardoso</b>. I was born in Brasil.
                I was born in a very poor Brazilian family. My dad was an alcoholic and violent man. My mom did her best to raise us.
                I learned to read and write when I was 4. My mom used to say that I was a very clever kid but also very naughty and energetic.
                My favorite type of movie is sci-fi. My favorite movies are Transformers and Batman(Darknight Trilogy). Despite the fact that I'm not a big fan of drama, I love the film Hidden Figures directed by Theodore Melfi.
                My hobbies are cycling, studying, listening to music and travelling. Another important information about me, I am a cat lover. Meet them on <a href="pets.html"><b>Pets</b></a>.
                I have had a dream of becoming an engineer since I was a kid . I have ended up being a teacher because of my family's social and financial conditions.
                Studying Engineering in Brasil is very expensive.
                Then I decided to take another path and start studying English.
                Since I was an excellent student, only 3 years after I had started attending the English classes, I was invited by the English school I used to study in,
                to particiate in a training course and then become a teacher.
                I fell in love with teaching. You may think "why are you attending CS50 classes?". CS50 is the fisrt step for me to fulfill my childhood dream to be an engineer.
